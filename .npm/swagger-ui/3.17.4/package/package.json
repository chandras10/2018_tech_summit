contribution?** Check out our [Good first issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) label.\n\n**üï∞Ô∏è Looking for the older version of Swagger UI?** Refer to the [*2.x* branch](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).\n\n\nThis repository publishes to two different NPM modules:\n\n* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc).\n* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger-UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can't resolve npm module dependencies.\n\nWe strongly suggest that you use `swagger-ui` instead of `swagger-ui-dist` if you're building a single-page application, since `swagger-ui-dist` is significantly larger.\n\n\n## Compatibility\nThe OpenAPI Specification has undergone 5 revisions since initial creation in 2010.
